### Software Defect Detection
Using dataset from Promise Repository (http://promise.site.uottawa.ca/SERepository/datasets-page.html) to prepare an ML model capable of detecting whether a software is defective.
This repository contains datasets, which contain data from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code.

### Approach
* Implemented Random Forests
* Logistic Regression
* Deep Neural Network
* 1D CNN
  
_Also used PCA as a method to reduce dimensionality and enhance the accuracy_
